# Titanic Survival Prediction
## Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to perform classification tasks. The notebook contains various cells that guide you through the process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Cells Explanation
1. **Data Loading**: This cell is responsible for loading the dataset into the notebook. It uses libraries like `pandas` to read data from CSV files.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: This cell handles data cleaning and preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This cell includes visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
4. **Feature Selection**: This cell selects the most relevant features for the model using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance scores.
5. **Model Selection**: This cell involves choosing the appropriate machine learning model for the classification task. Common models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
6. **Model Training**: This cell trains the selected model using the training dataset. It includes setting hyperparameters and fitting the model.
7. **Model Evaluation**: This cell evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: This cell optimizes the model's hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve performance.
9. **Model Deployment**: This cell demonstrates how to save the trained model and load it for making predictions on new data.

## Parameters
- **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size during gradient descent.
- **Number of Estimators**: The number of trees in ensemble methods like Random Forest.
- **Max Depth**: The maximum depth of the tree in Decision Trees.
- **Kernel**: The kernel type to be used in SVM.
- **Regularization Parameter**: Controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error.

## Machine Learning Model
The primary model used in this project is a Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification tasks.
